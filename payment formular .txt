***Repayments***

M= P*((r(1+r)^n) / (((1+r)^n)-1)).

M= monthly repayment
P=Loan Amount(mortgage Amount)
r = monthly interest rate.
n = total number of payments

r = interest rate(in decimal i.e divided by 100) * 12(months in a year).

n = years * 12(months in a year).

*** interest only***
M = P*r.
